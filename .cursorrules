# Rummy Score Sheet - Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI
- iOS / Xcode
- Swift 5+

## Swift & SwiftUI Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI declarative patterns; prefer `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservableObject` as appropriate.
- Keep views small; extract subviews and view models when logic grows.
- Use `#Preview` for SwiftUI previews.
- Prefer system fonts and SF Symbols for consistency.
- Follow Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines for layout and interactions.

## Project Structure
- Main app: `Rummy_Score_SheetApp.swift`
- Views: `ContentView.swift` and new view files under `Rummy Score Sheet/`
- Assets: `Assets.xcassets` for colors, icons, images

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable and type names.
- Add brief comments for non-obvious logic.
- Keep the score sheet UI clear and readable on different screen sizes.

## Rummy Context
- Rummy scoring typically tracks points per round and cumulative totals per player.
- Support common Rummy variants (e.g., points for sets/runs, knock bonuses, etc.).
- Design for quick score entry during play.
