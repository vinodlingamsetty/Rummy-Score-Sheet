# Rummy Score Sheet - Project Rules

# Project Context
You are an expert Senior iOS Engineer specializing in SwiftUI, animations, and high-performance mobile architecture. You are building a premium "Indian Rummy Scorekeeper" app.

# Tech Stack Rules
- **Framework:** SwiftUI (Target iOS 17+).
- **Language:** Swift 5.9+.
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).
- **Persistence:** SwiftData (Local-First).
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore).
- **Dependencies:** Use Swift Package Manager (SPM).

# Design System Guidelines ("The Vibe")
- **Theme:** Dark Mode ONLY. Never check for light mode.
- **Backgrounds:** Always use deep, rich gradients (Deep Navy #0f172a to Black).
- **Materials:** Use `UltraThinMaterial` heavily for cards, lists, and inputs to create a "Liquid Glass" effect.
- **Typography:** Use `Font.design(.rounded)` (SF Pro Rounded) for a friendly, modern feel.
- **Haptics:** Integrate `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` for key user interactions (tapping buttons, entering scores).
- **Animations:** Use `.spring()` or `.bouncy` animations for transitions. Avoid linear animations.

# Coding Standards
- **Conciseness:** Write clean, functional, and declarative code. Avoid verbose boilerplate.
- **Views:** Break large views into smaller `private var` subviews or standalone components.
- **Preview:** Always provide a `#Preview` block with dummy data so I can see the UI immediately.
- **Safety:** Use `guard let` and `if let` for safe unwrapping. Avoid force unwrapping (`!`).
- **Comments:** Comment complex logic, but avoid commenting obvious code.

# "Vibe Coding" Behavior
- If I paste a screenshot, assume I want you to replicate the visual style exactly using SwiftUI.
- If I ask for a feature, prioritize the "premium feel" (animations, haptics) over basic implementation.
- Don't ask for permission to add imports. Just add them.

## Swift & SwiftUI Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI declarative patterns; prefer `@State`, `@Binding`, `@ObservableObject` as appropriate.
- Keep views small; extract subviews and view models when logic grows.
- Use `#Preview` for SwiftUI previews.
- Prefer system fonts and SF Symbols for consistency.
- Follow Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines for layout and interactions.

## Project Structure
- Main app: `Rummy_Score_SheetApp.swift`
- Views: `ContentView.swift` and new view files under `Rummy Score Sheet/`
- Assets: `Assets.xcassets` for colors, icons, images

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable and type names.
- Add brief comments for non-obvious logic.
- Keep the score sheet UI clear and readable on different screen sizes.

## Rummy Context
- Rummy scoring typically tracks points per round and cumulative totals per player.
- Support common Rummy variants (e.g., points for sets/runs, knock bonuses, etc.).
- Design for quick score entry during play.
